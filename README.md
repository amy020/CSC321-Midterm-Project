About Me Website

Proposed Architecture
The architecture of this application will be composed of an HTML, CSS, JS, and Python (Flask) front end and a SQLite (or MongoDB) backend. Flask will be used to serve the web pages and handle form submissions for the contact section. The site will be designed to showcase personal information, skills, and projects in a simple and professional layout.

Database Schema (Initial)
The schema itself is relatively simple. Each visitor will be able to submit a message through a contact form, which will be stored in the database. There will also be data entries for projects displayed on the portfolio page.
